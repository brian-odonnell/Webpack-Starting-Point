# Webpack-Starting-Point

This is a Webpack starting point from following [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZGNcSuwBZs&t=339s&ab_channel=TraversyMedia) and duplicating my [Webpack Demo repo](https://github.com/brian-odonnell/Webpack-Demo). It is set up with:
* Webpack Dev Server
* HTML Webpack Plugin
* Sass Compiling
* Babel Transpiling
* Asset Resource Loaders
* Source Maps
* Cache Busting Hashes
* Bootstrap CSS

## Commands
* `npm run dev` : Starts a dev server at localhost:1234 and watches the code for any changes
* `npm run build` : Builds the project to the /dist folder
